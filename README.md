# scp-deployer

## Required Parameters

- `host`: Remote Hostname
- `username`: Remote Host Username
- `port`: Remote Host SSH Port
- `key`: Remote Host SSH Private key
- `password`: Remote Host Password (If no SSH key is provided)
- `source`: Source files location
- `target`: Remote Host deployment location

## SSH Private/Public Key
Below is the command for generations of SSH keys. For the complete manual the location can be found [here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen).
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
Generate and save the public key in the Remote Host at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` location.

The Private keys can be saved in the [GIT Action Secretes](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) for better security.

## Example
